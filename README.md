# Pomodoro Timer

by Christopher Tse

## About

A simple pomodoro timer that alternates between counting down a work session and a break time. This was made for the FreeCodeCamp [front end development project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

This was originally built on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/christse/pen/LyOrjE) before moving it to a standalone project. Made with JQuery.
